## This project demonstrates the application of optimization techniques to solve a real-world business problem using Linear Programming (LP) and Python. The primary objective of the project is to show how mathematical optimization can be used to make optimal decisions under given constraints, such as limited resources, cost restrictions, or production capacities. The project is designed as a beginner-friendly yet industry-relevant example of how optimization models are built, solved, and interpreted in practical scenarios.Optimization plays a crucial role in many business and engineering domains, including supply chain management, operations planning, production scheduling, and cost minimization. This project focuses on formulating a business problem mathematically and solving it using Python libraries, making it suitable for internship submissions and foundational analytics portfolios.
